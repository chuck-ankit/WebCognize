# WebCognize

WebCognize is an LLM-powered search engine that uses the OpenAI API to process and deliver relevant search results to users. It features a modern, user-friendly interface built with React, Vite, and Tailwind CSS, along with a Node.js backend for API handling and integration with OpenAI.

## Features

- **LLM-Powered Search**: Search results are powered by OpenAI's language models for relevant and intelligent responses.
- **Responsive UI**: Built using React, Vite, and styled with Tailwind CSS, providing a smooth and responsive user experience.
- **Backend API**: Node.js and Express handle search queries and interact with OpenAI to fetch results.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16 or higher)
- **npm** or **yarn**
- **OpenAI API Key** (for LLM-powered search)

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

Clone the WebCognize repo to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chuck-ankit/WebCognize.git
cd WebCognize
```

### 2. Set Up Backend

Navigate to the `backend` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd backend
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the backend directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

You can obtain an OpenAI API key from [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Start the backend server:

```bash
npm start
```

The backend will run on `http://localhost:5000`.

### 3. Set Up Frontend

Navigate to the `frontend` folder and install the dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
```

To configure the frontend, you may need to update the API URL if your backend is hosted elsewhere. This is typically done in the `src/api.js` file (if such a file exists).

Start the frontend server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will run on `http://localhost:3000`.

### 4. Test the Application

Once both the backend and frontend servers are running, navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your browser. You should see the WebCognize search engine UI, where you can search for content powered by OpenAI.
